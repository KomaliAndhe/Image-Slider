# Image-Slider
An image slider, also known as a carousel or slideshow, is a dynamic web component that displays a series of images in an interactive, rotating manner. Typically built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to navigate through images using next/previous buttons, indicator dots, or swipe gestures (for touch devices). Advanced sliders may include features like auto-play with pause on hover, smooth transition effects (fade, slide, or zoom), responsive design for different screen sizes, and accessibility enhancements. Image sliders are commonly used for galleries, hero banners, product showcases, and portfolios to create engaging, visually appealing content presentations. The project can range from a simple manual slider to a sophisticated carousel with thumbnails, captions, and lazy loading for optimized performance.
